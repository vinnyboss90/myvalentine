## Features
- **Bouncing Heart Animation**: A heart that bounces up and down using CSS keyframes.
- **Interactive Buttons**:
  - **Yes Button**: Cycles through messages before exploding the heart with a joyful animation.
  - **No Button**: Cycles through messages, eventually thanking the user for not breaking the heart.
- **Modern Design**: Stylish gradient background, smooth transitions, and responsive design.

## How It Works
1. The heart bounces continuously using a CSS animation.
2. When the user clicks "Yes":
   - First click: Asks, "Are you sure? üòä"
   - Second click: Asks, "Really sure? ü•∞"
   - Third click: Displays, "Yay! You made my heart boom with joy! üí•" and the heart explodes.
3. When the user clicks "No":
   - First click: Asks, "Are you sure? üò¢"
   - Second click: Displays, "My heart will break... üíî"
   - Third click: Displays, "Thank you for not breaking my heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è" and hides the "No" button.
